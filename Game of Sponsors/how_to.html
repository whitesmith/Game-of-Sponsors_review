                    Welcome to the Game of Sponsors.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    By starting this journey, you have an opportunity to become the traveler with the most exquisite and rare badges.
                    <br>Your main goal is to find all the augmented reality markers belonging to each of Pixels Camp's sponsors and scanning them <a href="scan.html">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    Once you scan a marker, you'll learn a bit more about each house <a href="houses.html">(sponsor)</a> and afterwards you'll be faced with a question about that house.
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    To answer the question, move the circle cursor towards the desired answer button and click on it to reveal your fate!
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    Well, if you want to find out more about it, why not play?
                    <br>But remember, "When you play the Game of Sponsors, you win or you die".
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    Would you also enjoy an extra adventure? And what about extra prizes?
                    <br>Check out <a target="_blank" href="https://cq.html">Castle Quest</a>, a side quest of Game of Sponsors to receive the Ultimate Badge!
                </p>

                <p class="">
                    <b> Disclaimer:</b> The augmented reality library used is still quite experimental. Only devices and OS's that support WebRTC will be able to use it.
                    <br> Ideally use Chrome or Safari for a better experience.
                    <br> If the scanning has any issues, try reloading the page or covering the camera with your hand for a few seconds, and position your phone parallel relatively to the marker.</p>
